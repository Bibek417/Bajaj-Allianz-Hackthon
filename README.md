# Hackethon Description 
World is still recovering from COVID-19 pandemic that brought many industries to a standstill for almost two years. However, it had an opposite effect on life insurance penetration in India. It took India’s life insurance penetration level from 2.82% in 2019 to 3.2% in 2020, which is close to the global average. The pandemic also gave push to online sales of life insurance. In financial year 2019-20, 12.5% of overall term policies by premium were purchased by Indians online. However, on savings side, it is still muted with less than 1% of total premium by channel.

For most Indians, insurance agents still are the ones who introduced the concept of life insurance to them and they remain an important part of customer’s policy purchase decision. But, with or without COVID, trends suggest that India is rapidly shifting to digital channels for purchase of financial products and insurance is not untouched by this phenomenon. Where agent influence remains a dominant influencing factor when it comes to insurance policy purchase, a lot of people are doing their own research and opting for direct purchase from online platforms. In such scenario, it becomes important to understand how they make purchase decision and how they select right policy for themselves.

# Challenge 
There are various factors that affect customer’s policy purchase decisions in addition to the vast number of channels - digital or otherwise. In this hackathon we want you to:

* Create segments of customers based on their persona. The segments should be defined clearly and should not be too similar to each other,
* Evaluate weightage of product features for each of the customer segments created,
* Create a recommender systems (statistical based model or algorithm) to find the attributes influencing the customer’s preference for product features
* Identify effect of market factors affecting these .
